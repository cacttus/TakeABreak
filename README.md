# TakeABreak
Us programmers sometimes overwork ourselves. That is why I wrote TakeABreak. This app forces you to take a break from typing for 30 seconds. It will save your hands some pain!

## Installation
* Windows App.
* Requires MahApps.Metro (via NuGet package manager).

## TODO:

* Remove Title Bar
* Add option for Fullscreen and Windowed (popup) mode.
* Put the app in the taskbar, right now it's invisible.
    * Add a popup on the taskbar icon with the option to select window/fullscreen mode.
    * Add an option to change the look & feel of the window
        * Use a dropdown and change the MahApps theme.
* Need to make the screen more pleasant looking
